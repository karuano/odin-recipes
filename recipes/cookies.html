        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks</li>
            <li>4 oz dark chocolate chunk, or your preference</li>
        
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
            <li> Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.  </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.        </li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.        </li>
        </ol>
